Project Description
This project is developed as part of the Kaggle competition "Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets", aiming to classify tweets into two categories: those about real disasters and those that are not. The project utilizes advanced NLP techniques and machine learning models to accurately predict the nature of each tweet.

Data
The dataset is sourced from the aforementioned Kaggle competition, consisting of tweet text and labels indicating whether a tweet is about a real disaster or not. The data preprocessing and exploration steps are detailed within the notebook, providing insights into the dataset's characteristics and preparation for modeling.

Technologies and Libraries Used
This project is implemented using Python, with significant reliance on the following libraries:

Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
Numpy for numerical operations
Transformers by Hugging Face for accessing pre-trained NLP models
PyTorch (torch) as the deep learning framework
Scikit-learn (sklearn) for machine learning utilities
os for interacting with the file system
